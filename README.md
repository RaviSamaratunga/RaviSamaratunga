# 😇 Ravi Samaratunga

**`Information Technologist(Data Management/Front-End Developer/Creator)`**

I'm Ravi Samaratunga, a passionate Information Technologist from Auckland, New Zealand. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

<br>
I am currently in attendance for my third and final year in the
Information and Technology Management degree. I am an eager and active learner when it comes to
front-end development and, overall, the Tech/Digital side of the work industry. Creativity, Transparency,
and Perseverance are the three pivotal and base foundations of my work ethic, which generates the
ability to indulge and flourish in my work thoroughly. Employing the three capabilities simultaneously
allows me to keep my work authentic and further aids me in successfully meeting the required criteria.
However, alongside front-end development, I have discovered a significant interest in data analysis,
cloud computing, and cyber security. By ardently engaging in my degree, I have obtained the ability to
analyze data critically. Furthermore, I can structure and separate this data to identify and mitigate the
problems at hand. I am also undergoing AWS certifications to ultimately get my Cloud Computing and
Solution Architect Certificate.
With the willingness to learn more about tech and apply my pre-existing knowledge to this industry, it
would be a pleasure to integrate my skillset with your ideas/needs
